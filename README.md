# PinkyClocky7-A-Windows7-Pink-Clockface-Gadget-for-Newer-Windows
This Repo contains my side project where I recreated that one pink Clock face that a windows 7/Vista had as one of their desktop Gadgets (Widgets). 

The aim of this project was simple: *"I really miss that cute pink clock from my Windows 7/Vista days, wish I could relive that same experience on newer Windows and Linux."*

While this clock may not be perfect or refined (the quality isn’t the best), it achieves exactly what I created it for: *it tells me the time, looks adorable, brings back some nostalgia, and makes my desktop feel familiar again like it did on Windows 7*.
